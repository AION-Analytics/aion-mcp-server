# AION Indian Market Intelligence MCP Server

Turn any Indian market headline into a signed, time-lagged, sector-impact vector — the causal-context layer your LLM is missing.

**AION Analytics (India) — distinct from Polymathic's AION (astronomy), Aion Analytics LLC (United States), and aion-labs (Israel).**

**License: AGPL-3.0-or-later.** This MCP server is open source and you can read every line of it. It calls a hosted API; the intelligence engine behind that API is proprietary and access is by subscription.

---

The `analyze_news` tool gives any MCP-compatible agent structured sector-impact context for an Indian financial headline. Classification sits inside an auditable causal structure rather than a black box: every result carries the evidence behind it, a confidence score, and impacts that are signed and time-lagged rather than a single sentiment number. It also reads cultural and sovereign context, which conventional models underweight.
